# DeckOps Trademark Policy

## Overview

"DeckOps" is a trademark of Jon Mullins. This policy explains how you may use the DeckOps name and branding.

The DeckOps source code is licensed under AGPL v3, which gives you broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the software. However, this **license does not grant rights to the DeckOps trademark**. Trademark and copyright are separate legal concepts.

## Why This Policy Exists

Trademarks protect users from confusion. If someone sees "DeckOps," they should know it's the official project or an approved derivative — not a random fork that might be outdated, broken, or malicious.

This isn't about control — it's about clarity.

## What You CAN Do (No Permission Needed)

### Use the code freely
Fork it, modify it, host it, distribute it — the AGPL v3 license permits all of this.

### Refer to DeckOps by name
You can say things like:
- "Based on DeckOps"
- "Compatible with DeckOps"
- "A fork of DeckOps"
- "Built using the DeckOps codebase"

### Use the name in technical/factual contexts
- Documentation that references DeckOps
- Blog posts, tutorials, or comparisons
- Academic or journalistic purposes

### Keep the copyright notices
You're required to do this under AGPL anyway.

---

## What You CANNOT Do (Without Permission)

### Call your fork "DeckOps"
If you modify the software and distribute or host it, you must rename it. Examples of what's NOT allowed:
- "DeckOps Pro"
- "DeckOps Enterprise"  
- "DeckOps Cloud"
- "MyCompany DeckOps"

### Use the DeckOps logo
The logo (if any exists) is not covered by the AGPL and may not be used without permission.

### Imply official endorsement
Don't suggest your product or service is endorsed by, affiliated with, or officially connected to DeckOps unless it actually is.

### Use "DeckOps" in domain names
Domains like `deckops.io`, `getdeckops.com`, or `deckops-hosting.net` require permission.

## Naming Your Fork

If you create a modified version, please choose a distinct name. Some examples:

| Instead of... | Consider... |
|---------------|-------------|
| DeckOps Pro | ComposeDash, StackPilot, DockerBoard |
| DeckOps Cloud | [YourCompany] Container Manager |
| DeckOps Enterprise | [Your Creative Name] |

You're welcome (and encouraged) to note that your project is "based on DeckOps" or "a fork of DeckOps" — just don't use DeckOps *as* the name.

## Requesting Permission

Want to use the DeckOps name or logo in a way not covered above? Reach out:

- GitHub: [@jxmullins](https://github.com/jxmullins)
- Email: [happyaccidents@squaresync.dev]

I'm generally friendly about reasonable requests.

---

## Contributing Back

If you contribute code back to the official DeckOps repository (via pull request), you retain copyright to your contributions, but you agree to license them under the same AGPL v3 terms.

---

## Summary

| Action | Allowed? |
|--------|----------|
